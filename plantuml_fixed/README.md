# PlantUML Fixed Diagrams

This directory contains fixed HTML versions of the PlantUML diagrams. The HTML files implement multiple rendering strategies to ensure reliable display of the diagrams.

## Features

1. **Pre-downloaded SVG Embedding**
   - SVG content is downloaded ahead of time and embedded directly in the HTML
   - No network requests needed for initial rendering

2. **Multiple Fallback Options**
   - If the embedded SVG fails, multiple PlantUML servers are tried automatically
   - User-friendly error handling with alternative rendering options

3. **Dark Mode Support**
   - Toggle between light and dark themes with the "Toggle Dark Mode" button

4. **Source Code Display**
   - The original PlantUML source code is displayed below the diagram
   - Easily copy the source code to clipboard

## How to Use

Simply open any of the HTML files in a web browser. They include all necessary resources inline and don't require external dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

If a diagram doesn't render:

1. Check your internet connection (needed only for fallback options)
2. Try clicking the "Open on PlantUML server" button to view directly on the PlantUML website
3. Use the "Copy PlantUML code to clipboard" option to paste the code into an online PlantUML editor

## Why This Fix Was Needed

The original HTML rendering approach had issues with PlantUML diagrams because:

1. **CORS Restrictions**: Browsers block cross-domain requests from local HTML files
2. **Network Connectivity**: The original implementation had no fallback if the PlantUML server was unreachable
3. **Direct Embedding**: The new approach pre-downloads and embeds the SVG content to avoid network requests

This solution provides a more robust way to view PlantUML diagrams locally, without server requirements.
